# Regex for the win!
###### (not guaranteed)

Use the guesser to get candidates for a [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) word (words containing 5 letters exactly).

You can use a list of words from any phonetic language: the list file must have all the words, each in its own line. example:

```
aback
abase
abate
abbey
abbot
abhor
abide
abled
abode
abort
...
```

Arguments:  
	- wordsList (-w): the file containing the list of words  
	- forbidden (-f): list of greyed-out letters  
	- otherPlace (-o): yellow letters separated by '|'.  
	  put '?' where no hint is given  
	  (e.g. '?|s|?|t|?' means that 's' is not in 2nd place  
	   and 't' is not in 4th place)  
	- known (-k): green letters separated by '|'.  
	  (e.g. 'r|?|?|?|t' means that there is an 'r' in the 1st place  
	   and a 't' in the last place)  
  
If no arguments are given, the script returns a random word.
